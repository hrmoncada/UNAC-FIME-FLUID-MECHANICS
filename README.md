# UNAC-FIME-FLUID-MECHANICS (MECANICA-DE-FLUIDOS)

*Fluid mechanics* is a fundamental branch of physics that deals with the behavior of fluids—liquids, gases, and even plasmas—and the forces that act upon them. Whether it's the blood flowing through your veins, air swirling around an airplane wing, or oil coursing through pipelines, the principles of fluid mechanics are at play. Its applications span a broad range of disciplines, including mechanical, aerospace, civil, chemical, and biomedical engineering, as well as geophysics, meteorology, oceanography, and astrophysics.

At its core, fluid mechanics can be divided into two main branches: *fluid statics*, the study of fluids at rest, and *fluid dynamics*, the study of fluids in motion and the forces that affect that motion. Unlike solids, fluids cannot resist a shear stress by maintaining a fixed shape—they continuously deform as long as that stress is applied. This key property defines what a fluid is and lays the foundation for the entire subject.

A modern perspective on fluid mechanics includes *computational fluid dynamics (CFD)*, a powerful discipline that uses numerical methods and computer simulations to analyze complex fluid behavior. From designing efficient aircraft and predicting weather systems to understanding how jet exhaust interacts with the ground or how a human-powered submarine glides underwater, CFD has become an essential tool in engineering and scientific research.

Moreover, the study of fluid mechanics involves a variety of classifications that blur the boundaries of traditional physics. Researchers distinguish between *laminar* (orderly) and *turbulent* (chaotic) flow, as well as *single-phase* and *multiphase flow systems*. These distinctions are not always clear-cut—fluids can undergo *phase changes* (like evaporation or condensation) during motion, transitioning from one classification to another. In some cases, even a mixture like air with dust can be treated as a single-phase flow for simplicity.

Ultimately, fluid mechanics challenges us to understand nature through both theoretical insights and experimental ingenuity. Whether using wind tunnels to test submarines or water channels to simulate jet exhaust, the fundamental behaviors of fluids remain strikingly similar across different contexts. Through rigorous analysis and practical examples, this course will equip you with the tools to model, analyze, and solve real-world problems involving fluid behavior.
